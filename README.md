## What This Does

Makes real-time credit decisions using machine learning. You submit application data (age, income, debt history), and it returns a credit score, approval decision, and loan terms.

## What's Built

**ML Model**
- XGBoost classifier trained on 10,000 credit applications
- 85% accuracy predicting default risk
- Returns credit score (0-850) and recommended terms

**Production API**
- FastAPI serving real-time predictions
- Automatic documentation at /docs
- Input validation and error handling
- Deployed with Docker on Render (live 24/7)

**Explainability**
- Shows top factors influencing each decision
- Required for lending compliance (ECOA/FCRA)

**Cloud Integration**
- AWS S3 bucket for model storage
- Docker containerization
- MongoDB integration (code complete, SSL issue on free tier)

---

## How It Works
```
1. Application Data → FastAPI validates input
2. XGBoost Model → Predicts default risk  
3. Scoring Logic → Converts to 0-850 credit score
4. Terms Calculator → Determines APR and payment terms
5. Explainer → Identifies top risk factors
6. JSON Response → Returns decision
```
